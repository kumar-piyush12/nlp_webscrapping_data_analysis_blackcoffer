Whilst made tremendous progress understanding activity years , research ’ answer questions relating nature emotions experiences . History Beginning late nineteenth century , psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind , typically equated consciousness . result , analysis behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management . Ancient Mayans propose sorted feeling degree consciousness , purpose , worldly association mankind . consciousness incorporates stimuli nature interior stimuli , Mayans trusted essential type existence , equipped evolution .

Sigmund Freud ’ psychoanalytic theory , believed levels awareness- preconscious , conscious , unconscious responsible ’ behavior thinking . believed mid divided parts- id , ego , superego . Id present birth , instinctual , operates pleasure principle . ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy . Finally , superego internalization society ’ moral standards responsible guilt . , Id regarded unconscious , ego superego conscious preconscious . Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches , , ’ conduct scientific experiments work heavily scrutinized , leaving questions unanswered . Sigmund Freud ’ theory differed psychologists theories understandable easily conveyed people . Sigmund Freud ’ work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth , character , memory , sexuality , therapy . , theories subject considerable criticism life . Whilst practical approach mystery conducting experiments , Sigmund Freud ’ provide evidence support claims . Today , essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally . Issues interest include phenomena perception , blindsight , brainwaves sleep , altered consciousness produced psychoactive drugs . greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters . , confirm criticalness verbal reports , researchers contrast action —that , search neural connections consciousness . locate noticeable action specific aspect , pattern global activity , greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness . imaging strategies , , EEG MRI scans , utilized physical proportions activities examinations . investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas ’ adequate create consciousness : workable subjects report absence awareness event , areas , , primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus . Higher areas viewed encouraging , prefrontal cortex , involved order functions . mainstream theory implicates examples waves creating conditions consciousness . Analysts record mind waves , drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum , electroencephalograph ( EEG ) placing electrodes scalp . types waves ( , beta , theta , ) correspond mental ( relaxed , alert , lightly asleep , deeply asleep ) Memory Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory . capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past . hippocampus located ’ temporal lobe responsible type memory . Consciousness plays part important memory distinctions . distinction implicit explicit characteristics ; explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious . , empirical findings suggest declarative memory consciousness ; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness . Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks . current ways testing information lacking essential aspects , including spatial resolution , temporal resolution , scope . Examples methods PET , fMRI , EEG , implanted electrodes , . PET fMRI temporal resolution problems , EEG well-known localizability difficulties , implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons ; , restricted scope . , huge speculations , testable fundamental level , difficult test . Mental illness Consciousness influence objects , encourages choices communicate . Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems , , agnosia ( failure decipher visual data ) , Alzheimer ’ disease , autism . , ’ comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object . disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome , minimally conscious , persistent vegetative , chronic coma , death . Locked-in syndrome , called pseudo coma , condition patient aware ’ move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body vertical eye developments squinting . individual conscious speak eye movements . minimally conscious , patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness . Patients give restricted , reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance . straightforward orders , comprehensible speech , purposeful conduct . persistent vegetative , patient sleep-wake cycles , lacks awareness , communicate , displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior . term refers organic body develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse coma , chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury , central brainstem sores . , metabolism matter decreases 50-70 % normal . patient lies eyes shut ’ environmental factors . death irreversible end activity , function ( including involuntary activity sustain life ) . total necrosis cerebral neurons loss oxygenation . death patient lacks sense awareness ; sleep-wake cycles behavior , typically dead deep sleep . Future predictions conclusion history scholar ’ endeavors study consciousness empirically , nature defined scientific methods . past , psychologists Descartes dualistic theories line fundamental physics . realists illusionists , taking fundamentally impossible topic ’ concrete evidence . observe neural examinations detect consciousness , sensory sector aware event clear signs reaction stimulus . Similarly , consciousness plays role memory , lack facilities research fully . future , possibility access facilities , , find neural connections ties mental illness . people making aware perspective things , give recognizing signs mental illness issues . , researchers continue study unknown part mind recover global pandemic , answer psychology ’ difficult questions .
